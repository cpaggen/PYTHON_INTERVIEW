# Python Interview Questions for Interns

This repository contains a collection of Python interview questions designed to assess the fundamental Python skills of internship candidates. The questions cover a range of topics, including basic syntax, data structures, error handling, file I/O, and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.

## Purpose

These questions are intended to help interviewers gauge an intern's understanding of core Python principles and their ability to solve basic programming problems. They are suitable for candidates with limited experience and focus on practical application of fundamental concepts.

## Questions Overview

The repository includes Python code with various interview questions covering:

* **Variable Scope:** Understanding global and local variables.
* **String Manipulation:** Reversing strings and filtering characters.
* **Error Handling:** Using `try-except` blocks to handle exceptions.
* **File I/O:** Reading and processing data from a CSV file.
* **Loops and Conditional Statements:** Using `for` loops, `if` statements, `continue`, `break`, and `pass`.
* **List Comprehensions:** Creating lists efficiently.
* **Data Structures:** Working with dictionaries and nested data structures.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Demonstrating inheritance and polymorphism with an `Animal` class and subclasses.
* **Instance Counting and Species Tracking:** Demonstrating class variables and instance tracking.

## Usage

The Python code in this repository can be used as a basis for conducting Python interviews. Interviewers can:

1.  Review the questions to understand the topics covered.
2.  Adapt the questions or create new ones based on the specific requirements of the internship.
3.  Use the code as a starting point for live coding exercises during the interview.
